# MMM-DelayedNotification

A [MagicMirror¬≤](https://magicmirror.builders/) module that listens for notifications from other modules and sends out **time-delayed notifications**.  
Useful for chaining events, reminders, or creating delayed effects after certain triggers.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Configure multiple rules for different triggers.
- Supports:
  - Single notification to send
  - Multiple notifications (array of strings)
  - Multiple notifications with **individual payloads**
- Rule-level payloads (shared across all notifications in a rule) or per-notification payloads.
- Flexible trigger matching (exact string, array of strings, or RegExp).

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/PenguPanda/MMM-DelayedNotification.git

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

        delay: 1000,
        send: [
          { notification: "FRAMELIGHT_OFF", payload: { brightness: 0 } },
          { notification: "FRAMELIGHT_PARTY_OFF", payload: { mode: "stop" } }
        ]

    ]

üí° Examples

1. Send multiple notifications without payloads

{
  trigger: "AUTO_LIGHT_OFF",
  delay: 1000,
  send: [
    "FRAMELIGHT_OFF",
    "FRAMELIGHT_PARTY_OFF"
  ]
}

2. Send multiple notifications with individual payloads

{
  trigger: "AUTO_LIGHT_OFF",
  delay: 1000,
  send: [
    { notification: "FRAMELIGHT_OFF", payload: { brightness: 0 } },
    { notification: "FRAMELIGHT_PARTY_OFF", payload: { mode: "stop" } }
  ]
}

3. Use a shared rule-level payload

{
  trigger: "SENSOR_TRIGGER",
  delay: 5000,
  send: ["NOTIF_ONE", "NOTIF_TWO"],
  payload: { source: "sensor" }
}

Both NOTIF_ONE and NOTIF_TWO will be sent with { source: "sensor" }
